# Changelog

Note: this script does not follow a versioning policy. Versions number are written just for reference.
This file may not be 100% correct: The true changelog is the git history.

## Version 2.2
- The Java object from the "key" file is now correctly deserialized, instead of just ignoring the header.
- The SHA256 of the googleIdSalt in the "key" file is now actually checked.
- Added an utility to read "password_data.key" and give a hashcat representation of the file.
- Moved the changelog to a separate file.

## Version 2.1
- Refactoring
- Added new command line options

## Version 2.0 is here!
Since the file format keeps changing, I decided to completely reimplement the script.
It should be much more efficient, and it should handle small variations of offset **automatically**.

## Version 1.1
- Added support for crypt14, via fixed headers.

## Version 1.0
- Initial implementation by TripCode for crypt12 files.
