# WhatsApp Crypt Tools
Decrypts WhatsApp .crypt12, .crypt14 and .crypt15 files, **given the key file** or the 64-characters long key.  
The key file is named "key" if the backup is crypt14 or  
"encrypted_backup.key" if the backup is crypt15 (encrypted E2E backups).  
The output result is either a SQLite database 
or a ZIP file (in case of wallpapers and stickers).  
This is the only thing this script does.

# Quickstart

## Cloud - Google Colab

If you do not want to install programs in your computer, you can run this program
[in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17z5UWE9dBbyvVfOG-KzRWCmTqFA3j82u?usp=sharing)
.  

## Local - Jupyter

If you are familiar with Jupyter (read 
[here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/jupyter-python/get-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python)
if you're not), you can use the
[notebook version](notebook.ipynb)
of the program.

## Local - pip

You can install this script as a package through pip. Just use:
```
python -m pip install whatsapp-decrypt
```

Install the development version with new features and tools:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ElDavoo/whatsapp-decrypt.git
$ cd whatsapp-decrypt
$ python -m pip install .
```

## Usage

 ```
usage: decrypt14_15.py [-h] [-f] [-nm] [-bs BUFFER_SIZE] [-ng] [-np]
                       [-ivo IV_OFFSET] [-do DATA_OFFSET] [-v]
                       [keyfile] [encrypted] [decrypted]

Decrypts WhatsApp backup files encrypted with crypt12, 14 or 15

positional arguments:
  keyfile               The WhatsApp encrypted_backup key file or the hex
                        encoded key. Default: encrypted_backup.key
  encrypted             The encrypted crypt12, 14 or 15 file. Default:
                        msgstore.db.crypt15
  decrypted             The decrypted output file. Default: msgstore.db

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --force           Makes errors non fatal. Default: false
  -nm, --no-mem         Does not load files in RAM, stresses the disk more.
                        Default: load files into RAM
  -bs BUFFER_SIZE, --buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE
                        How many bytes of data to process at a time. Implies
                        -nm. Default: 8192
  -ng, --no-guess       Does not try to guess the offsets, only protobuf
                        parsing.
  -np, --no-protobuf    Does not try to parse the protobuf message, only
                        offset guessing.
  -ivo IV_OFFSET, --iv-offset IV_OFFSET
                        The default offset of the IV in the encrypted file.
                        Only relevant in offset guessing mode. Default: 8
  -do DATA_OFFSET, --data-offset DATA_OFFSET
                        The default offset of the encrypted data in the
                        encrypted file. Only relevant in offset guessing mode.
                        Default: 122
  -v, --verbose         Prints all offsets and messages
 ```

### Examples, with output
#### Crypt15
```  
decrypt14_15 ./encrypted_backup.key ./msgstore.db.crypt15 ./msgstore.db
[I] Crypt15 key loaded
[I] Database header parsed
[I] Done
```  
or
```  
decrypt14_15 b1ef5568c31686d3339bcae4600c56cf7f0cb1ae982157060879828325257c11 ./msgstore.db.crypt15 ./msgstore.db
[I] Crypt15 key loaded
[I] Database header parsed
[I] Done
``` 
#### Crypt14
```  
decrypt14_15 ./key ./msgstore.db.crypt14 ./msgstore.db
[I] Crypt12/14 key loaded
[I] Database header parsed
[I] Done
```  
#### Crypt12
```  
decrypt14_15 ./key ./msgstore.db.crypt12 ./msgstore.db
[I] Crypt12/14 key loaded
[I] Database header parsed
[I] Done
```

## I had to use --force to decrypt
Please open an issue.

## Not working / crash / etc

Please open an issue and attach:
1) Output of the program (both with and without --force)
2) Hexdump of keyfile
3) Hexdump of first 512 bytes of encrypted DB

### I will happily accept pull requests for the currently open issues. :)

### Where do I get the key(file)?
On a rooted Android device, you can just copy 
`/data/data/com.whatsapp/files/key` 
(or `/data/data/com.whatsapp/files/encrypted_backup.key` if backups are crypt15).  
If you enabled E2E backups, and you did not use a password 
(you have a copy of the 64-digit key, for example a screenshot), 
you can just transcribe and use it in lieu of the key file parameter.  
**There are other ways, but it is not in the scope of this project 
to tell you.  
Issues asking for this will be closed as invalid.**  

### Last tested version (don't expect this to be updated)
Stable: 
2.23.16.76  
Beta: 
2.23.18.12

#### Protobuf automatic fix

You can install the proto optional dependencies to use `protoletariat` and fix the proto imports automatically.

First, after cloning the repository, do an editable installation of the package (possibily in a virtual environment) with:

`pip install -e .[proto]`

This will also install the optional dependencies of the package.

Next, download the protobuf compiler from its repository [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). You can move the protoc program to the `whatsapp-decrypt/proto` folder where the .proto files are.
 
Replace the protobuf classes as needed and run `protoc` to generate the python classes. From the `whatsapp-decrypt/proto` directory of the project, run:

`./protoc --python_out=../src/wa_crypt_tools/proto --proto_path=. *.proto`

After generating the protobuf python classes through `protoc`, from that same directory run:

`protol --in-place --python-out ..\src\wa_crypt_tools\proto protoc --proto-path=. *.proto`

Now all of the generated python classes should have their imports fixed.
